# Universal XSS via fullscreen element updates

### Reported by <mailto:marius.mlynski@gmail.com>, Oct 14 2016

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS
From `/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/Fullscreen.cpp`:

```cpp
void Fullscreen::didEnterFullscreenForElement(Element\* element) {
(...)
// FIXME: This should not call updateStyleAndLayoutTree.
document()->updateStyleAndLayoutTree();
(...)
}
```

Indeed. `didEnterFullscreenForElement` may be called in the middle of DOM node removal if the node being removed is the active fullscreen element and there are other fullscreen elements on the `Fullscreen::m_fullscreenElementStack` (see `Fullscreen::exitFullscreen()`). In specific circumstances, when the document's focused node is in a `<use>` shadow tree with a scheduled update, this synchronous layout update may result in events being dispatched at a wrong time, which allows an attacker to corrupt the DOM tree.
